Google Bard explains [this code](chdk-callfunc-original.html) (very badly)

__Warning__: This explanation is __incredibly__ wrong, see [this post]({% post_url 2023-11-20-google-bard-arm-assembly %}) for details.

The initial prompt, which aside from the actual code is the default for Bard's "explain code" option:

Bard's response

Sure. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the assembly language code you provided:

__Text section:__

```assembly
.text
```

This line tells the assembler that the following code is part of the text section, which contains executable instructions.

__Global symbol:__

```assembly
.global call_func_ptr
```

This line tells the assembler to make the symbol `call_func_ptr` globally visible. This means that other code modules can call the function at this address.

__Function definition:__

```assembly
call_func_ptr:
```

This line defines the start of the function `call_func_ptr`.

__Stack saving:__

```assembly
   PUSH   {R4-R5,LR}
```

This instruction pushes the registers `R4` through `R5` and `LR` onto the stack. This is done to preserve the values of these registers while the function is running.

__Register setup:__

```assembly
   MOV    R12, R0
   MOV    R4, SP
```

These instructions move the values of the `R0` and `SP` registers to the `R12` and `R4` registers, respectively.

__Stack setup:__

```assembly
   ADD    R5, R1, R2,LSL #2
   RSBS   R0, R2, #4
   BLO    stack_setup
   ADD    PC, PC, R0,LSL #2
   NOP
```

These instructions perform the following steps:

1. Add the values of the `R1` and `R2` registers, shifted left by 2 bits, to the `R5` register. This calculates the address of the function's stack frame.
2. Subtract 4 from the `R2` register. This is because the function's stack frame will need to store 4 return addresses.
3. Branch to the `stack_setup` label if the `R2` register is less than zero. This means that the stack frame is too large and the function needs to return an error.
4. Add the value of the `R0` register, shifted left by 2 bits, to the program counter (PC). This effectively branches to the return address at the top of the stack frame.
5. Insert a NOP instruction. This is necessary because the branch instruction in the previous step takes up two bytes, but the PC must be aligned on a four-byte boundary.

__Stack setup loop:__

```assembly
   LDR    R0, [R5,#-4]!
   STR    R0, [SP,#-4]!
   CMP    R5, R2
   BNE    stack_setup_loop
```

This loop copies the caller's stack frame to the function's stack frame. The `LDR` instruction loads a value from the stack frame at the address `R5` and decrements `R5`. The `STR` instruction stores the value from `R0` to the stack frame at the address `SP` and decrements `SP`. The `CMP` instruction compares the values of `R5` and `R2`. If `R5` is greater than `R2`, the loop branches back to the beginning.

__Register restoration:__

```assembly
   LDMIA  R1, {R0-R3}
```

This instruction loads the registers `R0` through `R3` from the stack frame at the address `R1` and increments `R1`.

__Function call:__

```assembly
   BLX    R12
```

This instruction branches to the function at the address `R12`.

__Stack cleanup:__

```assembly
   MOV    SP, R4
   POP    {R4-R5,LR}
```

These instructions restore the stack pointer (SP) to its original value and pop the registers `R4` through `R5` and `LR` from the stack.

__Function return:__

```assembly
   BX     LR
```

This instruction branches to the return address stored in the `LR` register.

__Pseudo-code:__

Here is a pseudo-code representation of the entire function:

```
call_func_ptr(func_ptr, arg1, arg2, arg3):

    # Save the calle
```

This is where Bard's original response ended, minus the markdown closing code tag. This appears to be due to some ~32K limit on output (although this wasn't obviously indicated or documented that I could find), so I prompted it again with
> The psuedo-code above appears incomplete. Please provide complete pseudo-code for the assembly language function you explained previously

("psuedo" typo in the original)

Bard's response:

---

Sure, here is a complete pseudo-code representation of the entire assembly language function:

```assembly
call_func_ptr(func_ptr, arg1, arg2, arg3):

    # Save the caller's registers on the stack
    save_registers()

    # Set up the function's stack frame
    setup_stack_frame(func_ptr, arg1, arg2, arg3)

    # Restore the caller's registers
    restore_registers()

    # Call the function
    call_func(func_ptr)

    # Clean up the function's stack frame
    cleanup_stack_frame()

    # Return to the caller
    return()
```

Here is a more detailed explanation of each step:

__Save the caller's registers on the stack:__

The `save_registers()` function saves the registers `R4` through `R5` and `LR` onto the stack. This is done to preserve the values of these registers while the function is running.

__Set up the function's stack frame:__

The `setup_stack_frame()` function performs the following steps:

1. Calculates the address of the function's stack frame by adding the values of the `R1` and `R2` registers, shifted left by 2 bits.
2. Subtracts 4 from the `R2` register to account for the space needed for the return address and the four function arguments.
3. Copies the caller's stack frame to the function's stack frame.
4. Stores the function pointer in the first slot of the stack frame.
5. Stores the values of the `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3` registers in the next three slots of the stack frame.

__Restore the caller's registers:__

The `restore_registers()` function restores the registers `R0` through `R3` from the stack frame at the address `R1` and increments `R1`.

__Call the function:__

The `call_func()` function branches to the function at the address `R12`.

__Clean up the function's stack frame:__

The `cleanup_stack_frame()` function restores the stack pointer (SP) to its original value and pops the registers `R4` through `R5` and `LR` from the stack.

__Return to the caller:__

The `return()` function branches to the return address stored in the `LR` register.

I hope this more detailed explanation is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
